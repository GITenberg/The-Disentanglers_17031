description: Whatever Mr. Andrew Lang writes he writes well. There is nish and polish
  to his work, the desiderata in all species of labor, but more especially in literature.
  His latest book, The Disentanglers, tends further to strengthen this generality.
  The plot of the book may best be given in the words of its originators, two young
  and impecunious gentlemen of London, as unfolded in the rst chapter, appropriately
  entitled The Great Idea; " Family rows about marriages. . . . The problem for the
  family, for hundreds of families, is to get the undesirable marriage o without the
  usual row. Very few people really like a row. . . . They want a pacic solution-marriage
  on, no remonstrances. . . . We are going to do it by a scientic and thoroughly organized
  system of disengaging or disentangling. We enlist a lot of girls and fellows like
  ourselves, beautiful, attractive, young, or not so young, well connected, intellectual,
  athletic, but all broke. . We send them out on demand, carefully selecting our agents
  to meet the circumstances in every case." The plot, as thus roughly sketched, presents
  almost unlimited poten- tialities, which Mr. Lang has fully utilized in the eleven
  stories that follow. This book is fully illustrated and annotated with a rare extensive
  biographical sketch of the author, Andrew Lang, written by Sir Edmund Gosse, CB,
  a contemporary poet and writer.
